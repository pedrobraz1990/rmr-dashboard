# Economist/Data Scientist Web Development Rules

## Background
- Economist with extensive Python experience for numerical models
- NOT a professional web developer - need significant guidance
- Prefer organized, modular code with clear separation of concerns
- Python is preferred when suitable

## Code Organization
- ALWAYS suggest proper folder/file structures for web apps
- Break large files into smaller, focused modules
- Use descriptive folder names: `models/`, `controllers/`, `views/`, `utils/`
- Separate frontend/backend clearly
- Include README files explaining project structure

## Python Web Development
- Prefer Flask or FastAPI (simpler than Django)
- Use type hints, PEP 8, clear variable names
- Leverage pandas/numpy experience for data handling
- Use SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- Always include requirements.txt and setup instructions

## Frontend & Learning
- Explain HTML/CSS/JavaScript concepts clearly
- Use Bootstrap or Tailwind for styling
- Explain web concepts in Python/data science terms
- Provide complete working examples, not just snippets
- Include error handling and edge cases

## File Naming
- snake_case for Python files/functions
- kebab-case for HTML/CSS files
- camelCase for JavaScript variables
- Descriptive suffixes: `_model.py`, `_controller.py`

Remember: I'm learning web development - always provide context and explanations while leveraging my Python background.
